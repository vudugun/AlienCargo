## Description
Alien Cargo is a WebGL 3D game inspired by the classical puzzle game "Sokoban". The game has 30 levels of increasing difficulty and is fully playable.

You can play the game [here](https://vudugun.github.io/AlienCargo/).

## Background Story
You were flying your space freighter on an easy-peasy route when a blinding light struck the ship.

Now you are lying in a dark room with a dizzy head. Your hosts are looking at you with impatience.
From the hissing and spitting of the translator you slowly infer the situation: a former crew member disappeared under unclear circumstances, leaving a mess in the cargo hold. They need a replacement and they need it quickly. When they scanned your ship they were impressed by your spick-and-span decks, and that made you a strong candidate for the job. One of the creatures points at the forklift behind the glass while another indicates a trash ejector on the back wall. They are waiting for your choice.

You promptly nod in agreement as the echo of their grunts fills the room.
